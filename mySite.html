            <p class = "introParagraph">
                Hey there! I am Dieudonne Makelele, a student at Brown University studying Computer Science 
                and Economics. I am an aspiring software engineer specialising in Machine Learning tools that improve market 
                outcomes across all levels from production to retail. Hello! I’m Dieudonne (Dee) Makelele, a sophomore at Brown 
                University, where I am majoring in Computer Science and Economics. My passion lies in AI and Machine Learning, 
                particularly in projects that push the boundaries of market technologies and contribute to the global trade landscape. 
                To build the necessary expertise, I have been deeply involved in gaming projects and machine learning endeavors, as 
                well as implementing and utilizing complex data structures and algorithms. These experiences have honed my skills in 
                Object-Oriented Programming, functional programming, web development, and User Experience design.Throughout my academic 
                journey, I have undertaken a diverse array of courses in Computer Science, Discrete and Applied Mathematics, and Economics,
                each contributing to my robust technical foundation. Additionally, I bring over five years of volunteer experience with non-profits,
                focusing on critical issues such as refugee education, human rights, and housing inequities.I am currently seeking opportunities in
                innovative and dynamic work environments where I can collaborate to develop cutting-edge technologies that deliver tangible value to 
                society. Let’s work together to shape the future of technology and trade.

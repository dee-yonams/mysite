                    <h5>TETRIS</h5>
                    <p> My version of the Tetris game is a bit challenging. It has conventional aspects like random bock generation, clearing of
                        full rows, game ending when the first a piece stops moving while touching the first row, and all other aspects. It has also
                        basic gaming features like pausing the game by pressing P, taking in navigation user inputs, and making sure the Tetris
                        Block stays within the visible game screen. However, some of its weird features include random assignment of color to
                        the pieces (in this program, we will call them blocks).In addition to that, the Tetris board does not show lines to mark
                        the paths of a block, it's blank inside. I chose this to add a bit of difficulty to the game in that the player needs to
                        be careful in determining where the block will land. Otherwise, enjoy the game - it was meant to be enjoyed!</p>
